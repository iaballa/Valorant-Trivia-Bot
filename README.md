# Discord Valorant Trivia Bot

A simple Discord Trivia Bot that asks Valorant related questions!

## Changes I'd like to Make:

- [ ] Add fuzzy/approximate text matching to account for typos like "vipe" instead of "viper".
- [ ] Improve bot speed. The bot slows down a good amount when you try to spam guesses. I feel like it might be an issue with the way I'm storing guesses and comparing them to the correct answers.
- [ ] Add a button that retriggers the /trivia command so that users don't have to retype it.
- [ ] Find a way to add images to trivia questions so that I can ask "What agent ability does this icon represent?"
- [ ] Find a way to increase the character limit for the Modal Label. Currently, only the first 45 characters of the question show up when the modal is open for users to submit their guesses, but I think it would be beneficial to be able to showcase the entire question in case users forget what they are answering.
- [ ] Add support for multiple servers to be able to use the bot at once. The bot only works properly in the Sunfall test server, and I would like to make changes so that the bot works properly in multiple servers.
